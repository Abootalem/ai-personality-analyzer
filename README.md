## Deployment

### Railway Deployment

1. **Connect your GitHub repository to Railway**
2. **Set environment variable in Railway dashboard:**
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
   ```
3. **Deploy**: Railway will automatically build and deploy your app

### Netlify Deployment

1. **Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify**
2. **Set build settings:**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
3. **Set environment variable in Netlify dashboard:**
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
   ```
4. **Deploy**: Netlify will build and deploy your app

### Vercel Deployment

1. **Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel**
2. **Set environment variable in Vercel dashboard:**
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
   ```
3. **Deploy**: Vercel will automatically build and deploy

### Other Platforms

For other deployment platforms:

1. **Set the environment variable** `GEMINI_API_KEY` in your platform's dashboard
2. **Ensure the build command is**: `npm run build`  
3. **Ensure the output directory is**: `dist`

### API Key Priority

The app looks for API keys in the following order:

1. **User-provided** (via the UI, stored in localStorage) - **Highest priority**
2. **Environment variables**: `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `API_KEY`, `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`, `VITE_API_KEY`
3. **Runtime injection**: For server-side injection on deployment platforms

## Getting a Gemini API Key

1. Visit https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the key (starts with "AIza...")
5. Use it in your environment variable or enter it via the UI

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues
- **"API key not found"**: Make sure you've set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable or entered it via the UI
- **"Invalid API key"**: Verify your key is correct and hasn't expired
- **"Analysis unavailable"**: Click "Set API Key" to enter your key manually

### Model Loading Issues
- **"Failed to load emotion models"**: Refresh the page, models are loaded from CDN
- **Slow loading**: The facial recognition models are loaded from remote CDN on first visit

### Video Analysis Issues  
- **"No faces detected"**: Ensure your video clearly shows a face
- **"Video too long"**: Maximum video length is 15 seconds
- **"Invalid video file"**: Use common formats like MP4, MOV, AVI

### Performance Tips
- Use shorter videos (5-10 seconds) for faster analysis
- Ensure good lighting and clear facial visibility
- For text analysis, provide detailed self-descriptions for better results

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Facial Recognition**: face-api.js + TensorFlow.js
